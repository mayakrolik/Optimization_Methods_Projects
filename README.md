### 6.C571/15.C571 Optimization Methods

As part of MIT's Optimization Methods, I am working on a few real-world based linear optimization projects usint JuMP and Gurobi.

So far the projects published here include:
* Network Flow Optimization - optimizing job allocations for a cloud computing provider
* Mixed-Integer Optimization - optimizing a waste management system for two fictional towns to minimize environmental impact and cost
* Optimization Under Uncertainty
* Nonlinear Optimization - Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Newton's Method

The work published here is my own, unless otherwise noted. I have recieved premission from my instructors to share my code.

Feel free to reach out about any questions!
